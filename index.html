    <p>
      A long time ago in Canada, after the revolutionary discovery of computers,
      all the cavemen want more so they can play video games. However, there is
      a shortage of rocks to bang, and the other cavemen are too lazy to get
      more. Because Mr. Bartucz is not lazy at this stage in life, he must
      venture across the land to make computers and save the cavemen from
      boredom.

      Young Bartucz can walk around with the arrow keys, pick up stuff by
      bumping into it, and drop stuff by holding the space bar and selecting a
      direction with the arrow keys. In order to win each level, young Bartucz
      must bang two rocks together (by dropping one rock on top of another rock)
      to make a computer. Then, he must carry the computer back to the start.
      Young Bartucz must use his big caveman brain to figure out how to manage
      his rocks in order to successfully create a computer and return it to the
      start.
